### **1. Overview**

| **Feature**                   | **AWS Load Balancer Controller**                                                                 | **NGINX Ingress Controller**                                                               |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Type**                      | Native AWS integration for managing ALB (Application Load Balancer) and NLB (Network Load Balancer). | Open-source Ingress Controller using NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer.           |
| **Layer**                     | Supports **Layer 7 (ALB)** and **Layer 4 (NLB)**.                                               | Primarily **Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)**, but can also handle **Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)** with custom configurations. |
| **Integration**               | Tightly integrated with AWS services (e.g., ALB, NLB, WAF, ACM).                                | Works in any Kubernetes environment (cloud, on-prem, hybrid).                              |
| **Managed vs Self-Hosted**    | Managed by AWS (ALB/NLB are fully managed services).                                             | Self-hosted and requires manual configuration and maintenance.                           |

### **2. Architecture**

| **Feature**                   | **AWS Load Balancer Controller**                                                                 | **NGINX Ingress Controller**                                                               |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Load Balancer Provisioning**| Automatically provisions and manages AWS ALB or NLB.                                             | Uses NGINX as a reverse proxy running inside the Kubernetes cluster (no external LB by default). |
| **Traffic Flow**              | Traffic flows through AWS-managed ALB/NLB to Kubernetes pods.                                    | Traffic flows through NGINX pods (running in the cluster) to backend services.             |
| **Scalability**               | ALB/NLB scales automatically based on traffic.                                                  | Requires manual scaling of NGINX pods.                                                     |
