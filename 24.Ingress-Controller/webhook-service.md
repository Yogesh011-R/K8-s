# Key Functions

## Mutating Webhook  
The service acts as a mutating webhook that modifies requests to the Kubernetes API server. Specifically, it sets the `spec.loadBalancerClass` field for services of type `LoadBalancer` when they are created. This allows the AWS Load Balancer Controller to manage load balancers automatically.

## Pod Readiness Gate Injection  
It can automatically inject readiness gates into Pods. When Pods are created with specific labels, the webhook service modifies their configurations to include readiness conditions, which helps manage the lifecycle of Pods more effectively.

## Integration with Kubernetes  
The service listens for changes in Kubernetes resources (like Services and Ingresses) and provisions corresponding AWS load balancers (either Application Load Balancers or Network Load Balancers) based on the defined rules and configurations in your Kubernetes manifests.

# Importance in EKS

## Traffic Management  
By managing load balancers, it facilitates the distribution of incoming traffic to multiple Pods, enhancing application scalability and reliability.

## Error Handling  
The webhook can introduce complexities, such as webhook failures that may lead to unscheduled Pods or failed deployments. Understanding how to troubleshoot these issues is crucial for maintaining a healthy EKS environment.
